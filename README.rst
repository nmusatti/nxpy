Nxpy is an etherogeneous collection of libraries, dealing with diverse topics such as 
wrapping complex commands with API's, automation of backup files, support for writing your 
own file-like objects and many other things.

The libraries are being developed with Python 3.7 so as to be compatible with Python 2.7. Tests are
run and most modules work also with 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. Some should still work with versions as early
as 3.2 and 2.5.

Originally the libraries resided on SourceForge at <http://nxpy.sourceforge.net> and were
distributed as a single package. Starting from release 1.0.0 each library will be packaged separatly
even though they will all share this project.
