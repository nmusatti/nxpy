Nxpy Command
============

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install nxpy-command

*Nxpy Command* implements a wrapper that lets you turn executables with complex command lines into
classes with methods corresponding to subcommands. *Command* is for one-shot executables, like
``svn``, and *Interpreter* is for interactive programs, like the original ``ftp`` client.

The library's documentation is available on
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command.html>`_.
