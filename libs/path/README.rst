Nxpy Path
=========

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install nxpy-path

*Nxpy Path* provides the ``blasttree()`` function, which removes directories in conditions where a
plain call to ``shutil.rmtree()`` is not enough, and ``CurrentDirectory``, a context manager that
helps keeping track of current directory changes.
 
The library's documentation is available on
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/path.html>`_.
