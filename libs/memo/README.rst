Nxpy Memo
=========

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install nxpy-memo

*Nxpy Memo* implements an abstract base class for types that need to control the number of instances
that may be created, e.g. to avoid duplicate ones. In other words it helps implement self-memoizing
objects.

The library's documentation is available on
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memo.html>`_.
