Nxpy Sequence
=============

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install nxpy-sequence

*Nxpy Sequence* provides the ``make_tuple()`` function, a tuple constructor that when given a
single string as an argument returns a single element tuple rather than a sequence of characters.

The library's documentation is available on
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sequence.html>`_.
