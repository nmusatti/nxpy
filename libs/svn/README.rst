Nxpy Svn
========

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install nxpy-svn

*Nxpy Svn* provides wrappers for the Subversion command line tools, ``svn`` and ``svnadmin``, which
make it possible to work with repositories and working copies in a pythonic way.

The library's documentation is available on
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/svn.html>`_.
