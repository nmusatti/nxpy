Nxpy Backup File
================

You can install the library with pip::

    pip install nxpy-backup-file

*Nxpy Backup File* provides *BackupFile* which is a file-like object that keeps a copy of a file
while it is being modified and restores it if an exception is raised; and *BackupDir*, which works
in a similar way for directories.

The library's documentation is available on
`ReadTheDocs <https://nxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backup_file.html>`_.
